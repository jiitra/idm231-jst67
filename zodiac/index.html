                    Las Vegas</em>
                channels your inner fire and uninhibited nature. You’re often described as electrifying, and the
                saturated neon colors in this film represent your quickness and spark. Face the world with courage and
                it will reward your confidence.

            <p class="card__description">
                <b>Taurus</b>, your element is earth, making you grounded and comfort-seeking. The sandy, warm color
                palette in <em>Her</em> speaks directly to your desire for stability and predictability. Muted earth
                tones make
                you feel right at home, and you aren’t afraid to stay loyal to your roots. You keep going at your own
                pace. Stop and smell the roses.

                <em>Amelie</em> is quite charming and unique, just like you! The scenes in this film often explore
                visual anomaly with
                complementary colors, which is similar to how you think out of the box and embrace new experiences.
                People may not understand you at first, but don’t give up your identity because of misconceptions.

                between
                shadow and light in this film mirrors your intense empathy for others. You feel both your own emotions
                and the emotions of others around you at maximum capacity. When you feel overwhelmed, take a deep
                breath. Your close circle will look out for you the same way you do for them.

            <p class="card__description">
                <b>Virgo</b>,you love systems and you seek problem-solving opportunities. The color palette in <em>La La
                    Land</em> fits perfectly into your organizational daydreams. Bright colors, often primary, are
                distinct from
                one another and signal narrative changes. What could be more satisfying?

                <b>Libra</b>,you’re receptive and charming. That’s what makes <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of
                    Secrets</em>
                perfect for you. The colors of Hogwarts are erudite and carry a degree of responsibility, which are
                qualities that your friends appreciate about you. You have a darker side that may be prone to worrying,
                which is represented by the deep shadows in this film. Trust your gut and your outlook will be brighter.

            <p class="card__description">
                <b>Scorpio</b>,you’re used to being told that you’re the darkest and most brooding zodiac sign. So, your
                pairing with <em>The Dark Knight</em> shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Similarly to Batman, you
                hide within
                your emotional fortress and fear being vulnerable above all else. The color choices in this film reflect
                your edgy emotional barricade, with lots of darkness and drama. Here’s a word of advice: lighten up
                sometimes. The world isn’t as evil as you think, and the people you trust are grateful for you.

            <p class="card__description">
                <b>Sagittarius</b>,you’re inquisitive and relentless when you find something to fixate on.
                <em>Joker</em>’s
                mixture of warm and cool colors represents your taste for exploration and your tireless passion. Some
                moments of the film are muted or bleak, but this does not have to portray a negative impression.
                Instead, it references your dedication to the truth, even if it is bleak. You’re an overachiever, and
                sometimes this quality makes you forget about the lighter and brighter colors in life. Be kind to
                yourself and remain open to new perspectives.

            <p class="card__description">
                <b>Capricorn</b>,you’re as straightforward as it gets. You’re an efficiency machine, sometimes perceived
                by others as stoic or cold. The color palette in <em>Lars and the Real Girl</em> is effective and
                restrained,
                just like you. However, there’s a lonely side when you funnel all your energy into work and
                independence. Warming up may change your color palette, but it would also make you feel a little less
                cold.

                <b>Aquarius</b>,you’re the classic over-the-top blue color grading from <em>Twilight</em>. You’re quirky
                and many
                may roll their eyes at you, but there’s also something inadvertently charming and memorable about you.
                For all the time you spend in your mind, it makes sense that you’re cloaked in blue, the cerebral color.
                Keep striving to be contrarian, and you’ll amass a crowd of dedicated followers.
